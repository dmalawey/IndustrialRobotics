## Industrial Robotics Course
This repo supports the Texas A&M Lab for MXET400, titled industrial robotics.  It's a lab-based undergraduate course covering Industrial Automation, Manipulator robots, and embedded systems.

## Lab Overview
Each lab session has tasks of interacting with a robotic lab bench setup, plus a few sensors & software elements operated at the students' computer.

### Conveyor & Robot System
The lab equipment is the basis for 1000 possible processes, but we established a basic demonstration which uses all of the key features.  The product is picked up by the robot arm, placed on the conveyor, sensed by a sensor, categorized by color, moved on conveyor, and stored in a rack.  Finally the product is sensed in the rack, and the industrial controller (PLC) verifies the process has completed.
